# Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any branch, ALWAYS check:

## 1. Check if branch was already merged
```bash
git log origin/main --grep="<your-feature-name>"
# If you see a merge commit, the work might already be in main!
```

## 2. Check if remote branch exists
```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin <branch-name>
# If empty, branch was deleted (probably merged)
```

## 3. Compare with main
```bash
git fetch origin
git log origin/main..HEAD    # Your commits not in main
git log HEAD..origin/main    # Main commits you don't have
```

## 4. Check branch divergence
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
# Visual check: does your branch look weird compared to main?
```

## 5. If branch was merged, create NEW branch from main
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/new-feature-name
# Then cherry-pick or recreate your work
```
